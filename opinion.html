		<h1>Three Website Opinion Article</h1>
			<p>	There are many websites out there that can be considered very good and some that are known to be terrible. As I was looking around at different websites, I found out that a majority of the good looking webssites were those that are very popular and the bad websites were those that one might not even know about. Therefore for my two good websites I chose Nike and Amazon, and for my bad website, I chose la paloma theatre's website, which is a local theatre back home.</p>
			<p>Nike is a very well known brand across the entire planet. They have become very successful not only because of their high quality products, but because of there modern and highly efficient website. One of my favorite things about this website is how the first photo you see is not overwhelming. Instead, it is not only a sleek photo, but is is very easy on your eyes. Another one of my favorite things about this website is the simplicity of the website. It is very easy to use the website and click around to find the product you are looking for. Moreover, the design of the website comes off as simple which is more attractive the one that seems to be overdone. The spacing in between each picture and the amount of pictures, for example, seems to be a very simple design which is very pleasing. Due to me not being able to make out what any of the code means, the code of Nike.com is very modern and new. What I could make out, however, was that they were using html and the language was in english. The first thing I noticed that I didn't know was the script element that they used. It seemed as though in this script element it was telling the website the essentials such as language and currency.  Furthermore, the layout did not make sense to me because I did not know a few elements that they used in their html code. On the other hand it was very easy to manuever throughout the website. The essential tabs can be found at the top of the page which were the search tab, shopping cart, and the more specifc tabs. It also had the deals and new releases on the first page. All of these things were able to be done while still maintaning a simple look. Nike's site also uses a limited amount of colors which consist of white, black, and whatever color their new release is, which is included in the photos. Black and White, however, are a couple of their main colors. This offers a simple look and a look that is very easy on your eyes. Overall, the nike website is a very good website because of its modern look, simplicity, and efficiency. </p>
			<p>Another famous company that is very successful because of its website is amazon. Amazon is an online store that has everyting from "a to z." Amazon is much greatly varies from nike because instead of just clothing and some accesories, they sell just about everything. Because of their variety of products their code is much more complex. To start off, their code is much more spread out and organized, unlike Nike's. They seem to have spacing between the different types of elements that are used which makes it more organized and it is easier to see types of elements that are being used. However, Amazon also uses the script element which is similar to Nike. For theirs, however, it says javascript after they open the script element. On another note their are more colors on the Amazon website. A few of their main colors include white, black, and orange. All of these colors seem to flow well together, especially with the photos that they have implemented. Although the Nike website does a very good job, the Amazon website still does a solid job on shrinking to fit your page. The Amazon website is also easy to maneuever throughout the website. It includes the same essential tabs as Nike which are the search bar, shopping cart, and the tab that opens up to a, what some might say, index to the website. They also include other tabs whcoh are your account sign in, returns and orders, and a try prime tab. If you do not know much about Amazon Prime is their memebership program where you get access to free shipping, movies, and so much more. It is nice to see this at the top of the web page because it is an attention grabber which then keep speople on their site instead of just clicking off right away. A little thing that is also a very nice thing about this website is the bolded letters above the products on the home page. It does a good job at pointing out obejcts that may interset you. It also emphasizes products that are being sold at a discounted price. This just makes it easier for the customer to open the website and start shopping. Moreover, Amazon is a very nice website that is easy to use which is one of the reasons for their success.</p>
			<p>Although there are very good websites that tend to be very successful, there are those that are very bad such as lapalomatheatre.com. The La Paloma Theatre is an old theatre that is in Encinitas, CA which is where I am from. I consider this website to be terrible because of their old design, lack of color, and lack of pictures to show off the history of the Theatre. First off, this website is very bad because it has a very old design that needs to be updated. The code is also very basic which adds to its old design. The code that is used is very basic. It is so basic in fact, I feel that a student in our class can make a better website than this one. Secondly, the lack of color on this website is huge negative. It mainly uses two colors black and yellow. The only other colors that are included are the colors in the pictures. On the left side of the page they have put the navigation which is all yellow and a very basic font. For the rest of the page they have used black as the background which is very boring and unappealing to the user's eye. One os the smaller things that they have is they have tabs which link to their facebook, instagram, and their email. These tabs are also poor pictures that include an unneccessary white border which makes it look ugly. These little details are all things that take away from the website and most importantly the picture on the home page. One thing that really ginds my gears about this website is the fact that they don't emphasize the history of the theatre which is something that would be easy to do on the home page. All they have on the home page is an old photgraph of their theatre which implies it is old. Instead, I feel that they should add more photos and a short paragraph about the theatre. The only good thing about this website is that it is easy to maneuver throughout the website. Because of its basic design there are 9 tabs on the first page which are very easy to click on. Overall, this website is very bad because of its basic and old design, boring color, and the lack of photos to show off the history.</p>
