<h1>State Website Review</h1>
<p><a href="https://alaska.gov" target="new">Alaska</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The colors on the Alaska state website are actually quite nice. Although I am not a fan of the Color choice, it does all flow cleanly and there are no colors that shouldnt be their. One of the nice things about the website is that right when you open the website you see the beautiful scenery of Alaska. Another positive thing about the website is it is easy to navigate. Not only that, but it is easy for me to find certain thing in the website because of the search bar. A negative thing, however, about the website is that it doesnt shrink or fit that page as the window shrinks.</li> 
</ul>

<p><a href="https://az.gov/#" target="new">Arizona</a></p>
<ul>
<li>First off the pictures and the colors are really nice on the Arizona state website. They add a lot of pictures that showcases the variety of things Arizona has to offer. It is also very easy to maneuver. Their home page only contains pictures and short summarys that may seem bad, but is actually a good thing because it is not all up in your face like some of the other websites. In my opinion, there really isn't anything bad about this website other than the fact that the pictures on the homepage are only able to change manually. As a consumer I would like the pages to change automatically because it gets boring after a while looking at the same picture.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://mt.gov" target="new">Montana</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The Montana State Website is, I hate to say it, very boring. The home page only has one picture that is very hard to see. When I come on to the Montana State Website I expect to see a plethora of scenic pictures that show off the mountains, rivers, etc. Not only that, but there is also not enough color. Throughout the entire website there are only two colors which are white and charcoal black. Other than that the website is very somewhat easy to maneuver and it shrinks to fit the page. The reason I say somewhat easy to maneuver is because there are a lot of tabs to choose from. Although there are a lot of tabs, it is not an overwhelming amount like Alaska's website, for example.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov" target="new">Nebraska</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nebraska Website is very nice because of the colors and the simplicity of the website. For example, when you enter the website there is not a load of tabs in your face. Also instead of a ton of pictures they only have one, included with rates and rankings that set their state apart from the rest. This is a nice touch because many states try to drown their bad rates and rankings out with tons of pictures which is nice at the beginning, but bad once you learn more about the state. Also the webpage shrinks to fit the window. One of the bad things about the website is the amount of extra space. I feel that even if you don't want to add unnecessary things to your website, it doesn't make sense to have large spaces in your website.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm" target="new">New Hampshire</a></p>
<ul>
<li>In my opinion, this is the worst website out of the 5. The reason for this is because of the outdated design, lack of color, and the overwhelming amount of words and tabs on the home page. First off, the website seems to be very old and everything is very basic. Second, although the colors are not terrible, the extra white space makes them a lot worse than they actually are. Finally, the load of tabs and words that you see in the beginning are an eyesore. Also the tabs are not appealing. For example, one of the links that you are able to click on says, "...for opioid addiction resources." This tab is a shock to viewers which further emphasizes the lack of appeal in these tabs. On the other hand, there is only one positive thing I can take away from this website which is the fact that the window shrinks to fit.   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Rankings</h2>
<ol>
<li>Arizona-I liked the pictures, color and the simplicity of moving throughout the website.</li>
<li>Nebraska- I felt that this one was just as good as the Arizona Website, but the extra space dragged it down a little bit.</li>
<li>Alaska-This one is in the middle because it had things similar to both the top and bottom 2 websites.</li>
<li>Montana- The Montana State Website is bad because of the lack of pictures. It was better than the New Hampshire website because it didn't seem as old.</li>
<li>New Hampshire- This is my least favorite because of the outdated design.</li>
</ol>
