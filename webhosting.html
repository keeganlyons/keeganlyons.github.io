<h2>I Prefer Go Daddy</h2>
<p>I picked Go Daddy because they are a well known web hosting service and they also offer variety of products that can help me and my website. Not only that, but it turns out to be a little cheaper than the competing services because the monthly rate is lower than the competitors. Also the domain prices are cheaper than the others.</p>
